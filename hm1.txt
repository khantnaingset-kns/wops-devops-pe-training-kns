Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are key technologies in the development of intelligent systems.
AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries by automating tasks and analyzing large data sets. NLP, on the other hand,
is crucial for developing applications that can understand and respond to human language. Both AI and NLP have seen significant
advancements in recent years, and their integration is becoming increasingly common in tech solutions.

As AI continues to evolve, the focus is shifting towards more generalized AI, which aims to handle tasks across different domains
without needing specific training for each. NLP is also expanding its capabilities to handle more complex language structures
and understand context better. Together, AI and NLP are driving the future of automation and human-computer interaction.
